## Project Overview

This project serves as an educational tool for understanding and applying concepts in dimensional data modeling. It includes:
- Examples of star and snowflake schema design.
- Tools to load, manipulate, and query dimensional data.
- Visuals to explain idempotency and slowly changing dimensions (SCD).

---

## Features

- **SQL Queries**: Scripts for creating, loading, and querying dimensional data.
- **Docker Support**: A `docker-compose.yml` file for setting up a containerized environment.
- **Database Dump**: A preloaded `.dump` file to kickstart the project.
- **Python Integration**: Python scripts to automate data processing and analysis.
- **Testing**: Integration tests for validating database queries and scripts.
- **Visual Aids**: Images explaining key dimensional modeling concepts.
